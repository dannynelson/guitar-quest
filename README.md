# Guitar Quest

A game for learning classical guitar



TODO:

- upload videos, and send to youtube (or vimeo) API
- allow recording videos directly in browser
- create data structure for pieces, levels, quests, tutorials, etc.
- configure heroku
- sendgrid - email verification and automatic email communication when pieces reviewed, skype lessons requested, skype lessons approved, etc. (or is there a better solution)
- stripe integration for subscriptions, and automatic billing
- flesh out user page to allow changing password, show a summary of current level, and all accomplishments
- footer with copyright? other random things?
- recruit previous students to try the app (especially mitch)
